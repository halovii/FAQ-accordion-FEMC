Front-end Mentor challenge using JS



I had some trouble horizontally centering the accordion icons (drop down icons) alongside the question headers, I used the ::after pseudo element and JS to create the dropdown but couldn't figure out how to horizontally center the header and icon without using margin/padding, any help is appreciated!
